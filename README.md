## Description:

Uber is one of the world's largest ridesharing company, providing millions of rides to customers daily. In this project, we will analyze Uber's historical transactional data to build a model for predicting ride fares.

## Goal:

Our goal is to identify key features that correlate with ride fares and build a model to predict fare prices. We will train algorithms on this data to create a robust fare price prediction system.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and transforming relevant features from the data.
- **Model Building**: Training a machine learning model to predict fare prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Displaying insights and results through visualizations.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gagan-K916/Uber-Fare_Price_Prediction-System.git
